          <h2>C++/C/python Language</h2>
          <p>Statically typed,Compiled generous purpose  language that supports procedural OOPs which makes me to be a part of language. Knowing a programming language doesn't matter ,knowing and understanding programming logic to the core matters. learning python try to learn and understand OOPS(object oriented programming )which is the most important part in learning python.</p>

          <p> Digital Marketing introduces you to the world of Marketing. Marketing your product seems to be an easy job but isn’t. Reaching to the potential clients and marketing your services to the right consumers is important.It would take half of the time than learning it on my or your own. Being a part of a Digital Marketing World helps me to learn right from the basics to the core strategies of Digital Marketing.</p>

          <p>If you want to do web development or any kind of programming, you need to improve your problem solving abilities and researching skills. You won’t get any better if you never exercise these abilities. Especially when your question has been answered hundreds of times.</p>

          <h2>My SQL</h2>
          <p>I learnt C++ in class 9 and after that I stopped doing anything, infact I didn't even practice at that time.I just love coding and when I joined my college, I again picked MYSQL and read book
            I refreshed my concepts. I again started coding and here I am still continuing.
            I recommend you to do the same as you also know SQl and other and then you can learn other languages.</p>

            <h2>Writing is Love</h2>
            <p>Go extensive and increase the breadth of your knowledge. Always be a learner and keep experimenting. If you really find something exceptional to your taste, dig into it till the core.verbal communication would seem to be the most important, as we talk all the time. However, our written word is what we rely on when we cannot speak. Be it because of physical, or technical limitation, our written words can be crucial to our survival and success. Without proper writing skills, your voice is silent if you aren't physically present. Your ideas are locked in your head. Heck, without good writing skills, we wouldn't be having this discussion..</p>

            <h1>Dance</h1>
            <h2>Energy Booster</h2>
            <p>Dance enables stress relief not just internally but also helps you deal with things which might be increasing your stress levels.

              Dance boosts confidence. It allows you to loosen your body and relax your nerves. The more comfortable you are, the more confident you will feel It might seem strange, but virtually all of us know how great it feels to ‘get something off our heart’ by writing in a diary or ranting to a friend. Dancing provides a great way to blow off steam by giving us a more cathartic way to convey our emotions.</p>

            <h2>Fitness Freak</h2>
            <p>It’s no surprise that the more you help your body, the more you help your mind. Physical activity increases the flow of oxygen to your brain. It also increases the amount of endorphins, the “feel-good” chemicals, in your brain. For this reason, it’s not surprising that people who are in good physical shape also tend to enjoy a higher level of mental agility.Engaging in a vigorous physical workout can help you battle depression and gain a more positive outlook on life. It’s also a great way to beat stress, which can harm you mentally and physically.</p>

            <h2>It's Dreaming</h2>
            <p>The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries.I get so disenfranchised reading the news, because global borders and lines we've created are completely unnecessary. That's just another person on the other side, and it's his bad luck that he was born there and it's my good fortune that I was born here. It's all kind of illogical.</p>

            <h2>Capturing is Love</h2>
            <p>To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place… I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do</p>
